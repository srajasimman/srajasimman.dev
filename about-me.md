**🚀 Who I Am**

I'm a pragmatic and outcome-driven Cloud & DevOps Architect with over a decade of experience in **building scalable, observable, and cost-efficient cloud-native platforms** across AWS, GCP, and Azure. My career spans **DevOps, SRE, Cloud Operations**, and **Platform Engineering**, with a deep passion for automation, open source, and continuous learning.

I've architected and delivered mission-critical infrastructure for large-scale platforms including [**DIKSHA**](https://diksha.gov.in/), [**IGOT Karmayogi Bharat**](https://igotkarmayogi.gov.in/), and others, helping teams adopt **GitOps, Kubernetes, IaC, and SRE best practices**. I’ve also led successful **cloud migrations, cost optimization**, and **DevSecOps transformations**, impacting platform performance, reliability, and security.

**🧩 Core Philosophy**

> "Design systems that don’t need babysitting."

I believe in building **resilient, self-healing systems** backed by **automation-first** thinking. Whether it’s infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, observability, or incident response, my approach is to **eliminate toil**, **create repeatable patterns**, and **empower development teams** through platforms that just work.

**🎯 My Strengths**

- ✅ **Cloud Strategy & Architecture** – Multi-cloud experience in AWS, GCP, Azure. Infra design focused on HA, DR, cost-efficiency.
- ✅ **SRE & Observability** – Driven SLAs/SLOs, error budgets, Prometheus, Grafana, Alerting, Blackbox testing.
- ✅ **Platform Engineering** – Self-service tools using ArgoCD, Helm, GitHub Actions, internal developer portals.
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipelines** – Built secure, scalable GitHub Actions pipelines for Docker/K8s/Helm apps.
- ✅ **Cost Optimization** – Helped reduce ₹30L/month cloud spend using smart architecture and tooling.
- ✅ **Security & Compliance** – DevSecOps, secrets management, policy-as-code, container scanning.
- ✅ **Leadership & Mentorship** – Led teams across DevOps/SRE functions. Known for being hands-on, mentoring juniors, and elevating team maturity.
